                <br><a title="The beginning of the new century was a turning point for the world – another experiment on people, turning an ordinary person into an ideal soldier, failed, and the situation got out of control. Entire States were wiped off the face of the earth, while others were in chaos and utter anarchy. The best minds, representatives of power and high society went to the bottom, leaving the rest to perish on the surface.

Through my tears and cheers, I have been indeed transformed by the tender mercy with which William Paul Young opened the veil that too often separated me from God and from myself. With every page, the complicated do’s and don’ts that distort a relationship into a religion were washed away as I understood Father, Son, and Spirit for the first time in my life.”";

When it came, the shrieking tones blew up like a pipe bomb between my ears. Other girls at Thurmond could pick themselves up after a few minutes, shaking off the nausea and disorientation like the loose grass clinging to their camp uniforms. But me? Hours would pass before I was able to piece myself back together.";
